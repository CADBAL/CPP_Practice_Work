# This project is used to experiment with c++ and learn how to use it within VS CODE

# 1: tasks.json

# 2: launch.json

# To properly set up WSL. Install the WSL extension with VS CODE.
# Then close the github repository to the home/user directory. 
# This also represents the ~/ directory(home directory of logged in user)

# When running a make file in subdirectory in bash write "make -C path"
# e.g "make -C Chapter2/2.8

# When working in a windows environment, to install 'make' you need to first install chocalatey
# (Next steps still need to be examined then will be put on this line)

# To check if make is installed in windows type make --version oin powershell
# To make powershell default terminal open command palette (ctrl + shift + p)
# then select Terminal: Select Default Profile

# To ensure debugging is properly setup look through the .vscode files.
# Majority of the time WSL within VSCODE is used for this project
# Need to ensure GDB is installed for debugging using below commands.
