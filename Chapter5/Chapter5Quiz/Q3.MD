# The difference between std::string and std::string_view is that std::string can be a copy of a value which means it can be modified. std::string is expensive because it initializes and copies a value. std::string_view is just a "view" of a specific string. 

# The issue with std::string_view is that it does not own the data. If the object it is “viewing” gets destroyed, the string_view becomes a dangling reference — it still points to memory that no longer contains a valid string. Using it (e.g., printing) is undefined behavior: it might print garbage, crash, or appear to “work” by accident.
