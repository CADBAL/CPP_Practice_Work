# 1 a) Named constants are better than literal constants because literal constants, also known as "magic numbers" makes your program harder to understand. It also makes maintaining and modifying your code more complicated, you would need to look at every occurence of magic numbers to troubleshoot. If you just used named constants it would be easier to maintain your code and find issues in the program if there are any.

# 1 b) const/constexpr are better than #defined symbolic constants because preprocesser macros can lead to undefined behaviour if a variables in the program have the same identifier as the #defined symbolic constant. Instances of the variable identifier being used will be overwritten by #defined symbolic constant with the same name. An example is #define X 10 then writing int x {10};. This becomes int 10 {10} which makes no sense. Also The debugger won't show the #defined symbolic constant because they dissapear after pre-processing which makes troubleshooting your program complicated.
